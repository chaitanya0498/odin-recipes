            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>tomatoes</li>
                <li>onions</li>
                <li>cloves</li>
                <li>chicken or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>flour</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large stockpot, boil the tomatoes, onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth until the flavors blend together, about 20 minutes. Run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl. This will separate any big chunks, plus the tomato skins. If you don't have a food mill, a food processor or immersion blender will work too.</li>
                <li>In the original stockpot, mix melted butter and flour to create a roux.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the tomato mixture to the stockpot, whisking continuously so no lumps form. Season with salt and sugar to taste.</li>
            </ol>
